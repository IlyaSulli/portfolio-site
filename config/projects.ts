      "All Eat, a mobile application designed and developed to address the gap in food delivery apps, the need for a more accessible way to order food for people with food allergies and dietary needs. Through comprehensive interviews with stakeholders including those with allergies and those without, the project aimed at being inclusive for everyone while still having a simple and easy to use interface.\n\nThe app uses a profile based system where each user on the app has their own diets and allergies selected and filters out unsafe dishes and removes recommendations which do not fit with the needs. It also features allergy-aware ordering, guest-friendly profiles, live delivery tracking, and post-meal feedback integration, all aimed at creating a safer and intuitive food delivery experience\n\nFollowing an agile development methodology allowed for iterative testing and stakeholder checks to ensure standards were kept high. It makes use of a 3NF relational database, capturing ingredients for each dish, tags, diets and recommendation meta data including cuisines, restaurant locations in order to support the algorithm. Developed in Dart with a Flutter front-end and supported with PHP/MySQL on the backend and SQLite on the user's app allowed for seamless integration with the cloud, facilitating syncing in real-time. The final product not only streamlines the ordering process but also sets a new standard for recommendations.",
