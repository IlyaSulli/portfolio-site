      "All Eat, a mobile application designed and developed to address the gap in food delivery apps, the need for a more accessible way to order food for people with food allergies and dietary needs. Through comprehensive interviews with stakeholders including those with allergies and those without, the project aimed at being inclusive for everyone while still having a simple and easy to use interface. \n\nThe app uses a profile based system where each user on the app has their own diets and allergies selected and filters out unsafe dishes and removes recommendations which do not fit with the needs. It also features allergy-aware ordering, guest-friendly profiles, live delivery tracking, and post-meal feedback integration, all aimed at creating a safer and intuitive food delivery experience\n\nFollowing an agile development methodology, allowed for iterative testing and stakeholder to check the product in development to ensure that it still kept with their needs. The project makes use of a 3NF relational database, capturing ingredients for each dish, tags, diets and recommendation meta data including cuisines, and restaurant locations - combined, it allows for more personalised recommendations. Developed in Dart with a Flutter front-end and supported with PHP/MySQL on the backend  allowed for seamless integration with the cloud, facilitating syncing in real-time. The final product not only streamlines the ordering process but also a new standard for recommendations",

I also explored A/B marketing strategies, running targeted campaigns to reach customers in the local area effectively.\n \nTo provide more value and trust in the business, I maintained a blog that educated users about common problems with their devices and solutions to many of them and how to prevent many of these issues from occurring again and provided a free service to do over the phone troubleshooting help.\n \nThis project strengthened my skills in web development, automation, user experience design, marketing, customer communication, and business management, all while operating in a fast paced, client-facing environment",

Through this module, we were taught about the fundamentals of GitHub and servers, learning how to generate and pitch ideas using an Engineering Design Review (EDR). After pitching our individual ideas, we formed teams of four and used the EDR framework to collaboratively design the product.\n\nAs the team lead, I was responsible for delegating tasks based on each member's strengths and managing the project's progress. I handled the frontend development for the cart system, ensuring a clean and intuitive user interface while coordinating with the rest of the team to integrate our work seamlessly. By performing it this way, each person was responsible with communicating with 2 people instead of the entire team while also allowing for mutual interaction.\n\nThroughout the project, we used our skills learnt in the lectures, to use GitHub effectively for task management and tracking issues. On top of this, our weekly meetings allowed each of us to talk about the project and aid each other in areas we were struggling at. This allowed us to get the project completed to a high standard and as a result we got a First in this module.",

The application contains a study page which compiles the flashcards from the documents and uses spaced repetition, encouraging long-term memory retention. Each document and flashcard, blocks can be inserted including text, tables, code, images and PDFs. Users can also export their documents into a variety formats or share them publicly.\n\nBlocDoc also includes an intelligent deadlines module to track assignments and assessments to allow users to manage their workload with colour-coded levels of priority - After a deadline is marked completed, it is placed in an archived table.",

As a result they often missthe warning signs of a scam putting themselves at risk oflosing data or money. People who do notice signs oftenonly do so in a reactive way. With increasinglypersonalised AI driven scams emerging, it is becomingharder to distinguish between scams and genuinecommunication. \n\n From this, we went through multiple stages of ideation and refinement to come up with an all-in-one communication app designed to stop scammers and protect the user through authentication and real-time analysis. Using third party research papers, we looked at ways to detect scams including the latest generation of deepfake technology to mitigate and pre-emptively stop scammers.",
