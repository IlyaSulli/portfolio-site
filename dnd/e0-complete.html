        <p>
            to the sprawling City of Gear Mark, where cutting-edge technology leads innovation. Here,
            the streets hum with the sound of whirring gears, and the movement of hundreds of thousands of machines and
            creatures. This is a city that never rests.
            <br><br>
            The City of Gear Mark was once envisioned as a utopia, a shining beacon of progress in a world teetering on
            the edge of chaos. Its founders dreamed of a place where innovation and ingenuity would lead to prosperity
            for allâ€”a city where the marvels of steampunk, cyberpunk and arcane technology that would uplift the world to new heights.
            But dreams have a way of twisting in the shadows, and Gear Mark is now a city divided, a place where corruption
            festers beneath the surface and power is wielded by the ruthless.
            <br><br>
            You have been brought to this city for a singular purpose: to do the dirty work that keeps it running.
            Alongside other creatures, you serve as the backbone of Gear Mark, taking on the menial tasks that machines
            refuse to do. The life you knew is gone, replaced by a new identity and a harsh new reality.
        </p>
        <p>Your task:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make your character sheet of who you were (if you haven't made it yet)</li>
            <li>Craft a story of who you are now in the city, including your name, occupation, and a brief backstory
                of your past year in Gear Mark.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Are you ready to embark on this adventure?</p>
