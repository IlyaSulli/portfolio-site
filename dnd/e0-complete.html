            The planet of Novaterra, a planet of beauty and natural magic where life is simple but not perfect. Primitive tribal battles scar the landscape, and survival is never guaranteed. Amid the chaos lies Gear Mark, an android-made city, protected by a mile-high wall, acting as a refuge for all androids within. Known by many, this city claims to offer a haven for the greatest minds, where engineers, inventors and creators collaborate to build a brighter future - A beacon of progress. Few have been selected to join and you were one of them, selected for your talent and unique gifts you can offer for the city.
            <br><br>
            What happens when everything you have been told is a lie? Behind Gear Mark's façade lies a dark truth - creatures throughout the city have had their lives from outside the city erased, replaced with fabricated memories that keep you under their control. You weren’t brought here to thrive - you were brought here to serve, a cog in their elaborate machine, forcing you to do their dirty work.
            <br><br>
            A rebellion is brewing from within, run by creatures who were able to break the technology which held their lives under a fog of lies. They have awoken you from this and ask you to join them in this battle. Their mission: to dismantle the android regime, uncover the truths buried deep within Gear Mark, and free all who are trapped under its control.
            <br><br>
            <b>How much are you willing to sacrifice in order to reclaim who you were outside this city, and fight for a world where freedom is not a life of lies?</b>
