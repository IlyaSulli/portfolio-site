Through comprehensive interviews with stakeholders including those with allergies and those without, the project aimed at being inclusive for everyone while still having a simple and easy to use interface. \n\nThe app uses a profile based system where each user on the app has their own diets and allergies selected and filters out unsafe dishes and removes recommendations which do not fit with the needs. It also features allergy-aware ordering, guest-friendly profiles, live delivery tracking, and post-meal feedback integration, all aimed at creating a safer and intuitive food delivery experience\n\nFollowing an agile development methodology, allowed for iterative testing and stakeholder to check the product in development to ensure that it still kept with their needs. The project makes use of a 3NF relational database, capturing ingredients for each dish, tags, diets and recommendation meta data including cuisines, and restaurant locations - combined, it allows for more personalised recommendations. Developed in Dart with a Flutter front-end and supported with PHP/MySQL on the backend  allowed for seamless integration with the cloud, facilitating syncing in real-time. The final product not only streamlines the ordering process but also a new standard for recommendations",url:"alleat",startDate:"2022-03",endDate:"2023-03",classification:["A-Level Project"],type:"App Development",languages:["Dart","Flutter","MySQL","PHP"],tools:["Adobe Illustrator","Figma","Visual Studio Code"],thumbnailImage:"/image/projects/alleat/slides/alleathomepageslide.webp",coverImage:"/image/projects/alleat/alleathomepage.png",imageGallery:["/image/projects/alleat/slides/alleatcategoriesslide.webp","/image/projects/alleat/slides/alleatconfirmedorderslide.webp","/image/projects/alleat/slides/alleathomepageslide.webp","/image/projects/alleat/slides/alleatitemslide.webp"]},{title:"Kat Sullivan",description:"Kat Sullivan's blog website was developed from the ground up to be accessible for her to manage her content and constantly update it with any changes she needed to make - to facilitate this, I made use of WordPress which has a simple to use block based page building system.

The application contains a study page which compiles the flashcards from the documents and uses spaced repetition, encouraging long-term memory retention. Each document and flashcard, blocks can be inserted including text, tables, code, images and PDFs. Users can also export their documents into a variety formats or share them publicly.\n\nBlocDoc also includes an intelligent deadlines module to track assignments and assessments to allow users to manage their workload with colour-coded levels of priority - After a deadline is marked completed, it is placed in an archived table.",url:"blocdoc",startDate:"2025-01-19",endDate:"2025-05-04",coverImage:"/image/projects/blocdoc/blocdocdocument.png",thumbnailImage:"/image/projects/blocdoc/slides/blocdocdocumentslide.webp",classification:["University Project"],type:"Web Development",languages:["TypeScript","CSS","Java"],tools:["JHipster","Docker","Figma","Visual Studio Code"],imageGallery:["/image/placeholder.jpg"]},{title:"Advanced News Classifier",description:"",url:"newsclassifier",startDate:"2023-11-27",endDate:"2023-12-11",classification:["University Project"],type:"Machine Learning Development",languages:["Java"],tools:["IntelliJ IDEA"],thumbnailImage:"/image/projects/newsclassifier/slides/newsclassifierslide.webp",coverImage:"/image/projects/newsclassifier/newsclassifier.png",imageGallery:[""]},{title:"Record Shop",description:"",url:"recordshop",startDate:"2024-03-14",endDate:"2024-05-02",tags:["Small Project","University Project","Backend Development","Database Development"],languages:["Java","JavaFX","PostgreSQL"],tools:["IntelliJ IDEA"],thumbnailImage:"/image/projects/recordshop/slides/recordshopslide.webp",coverImage:"/image/projects/recordshop/recordshop.png",imageGallery:[""]},{title:"30 Days of UI",description:"",url:"30daysofui",startDate:"2025-08",endDate:"2025-09",classification:["Personal Project","Challenge"],languages:[],type:"UI/UX Design",tools:["Figma","Adobe Photoshop","Adobe Illustrator"],thumbnailImage:"image/projects/30daysofui/slides/30daysofuislide.webp",coverImage:"/image/projects/30daysofui/30daysofui.png",imageGallery:["/image/placeholder.jpg"]}]},7471:(e,t,a)=>{"use strict";a.d(t,{A:()=>n});var s=a(7876),i=a(3894);a(4232);var o=a(5643),l=a(1543),r=a(7355);function n(e){let{nItems:t}=e,a=r.d.sort((e,t)=>new Date(t.endDate).getTime()-new Date(e.endDate).getTime()).slice(0,t);return(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 grid ",children:0===a.length?(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"p-2 w-full text-left relative",children:[(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"aspect-square object-cover bg-foreground rounded-xl opacity-50"}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"absolute top-0 z-10 flex flex-row justify-center p-6",children:(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"flex items-center gap-2 bg-background rounded-full px-4 py-2",children:(0,s.jsx)("span",{className:"text-foreground",children:"No Items Found"})})})]}):a.map((e,t)=>(0,s.jsx)(o.P.div,{whileHover:{rotateZ:2,rotateX:-2,scale:.95},children:(0,s.jsxs)("button",{"aria-haspopup":"dialog",className:"p-2 w-full text-left relative",type:"button",onClick:()=>window.location.href="../project/".concat(e.url),children:[(0,s.jsx)(i.W,{className:"aspect-square object-cover",src:e.thumbnailImage,width:600}),(0,s.jsx)("div",{className:"absolute top-0 right-0 z-10 flex flex-row justify-end p-6",children:(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex items-center gap-2 bg-background rounded-full px-4 py-2",children:[(0,s.jsx)("span",{children:e.title}),(0,s.jsx)(l.Qp,{})]})})]})},t))})}}},e=>{var t=t=>e(e.s=t);e.O(0,[892,630,184,636,593,792],()=>t(6779)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
